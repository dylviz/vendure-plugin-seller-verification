# Vendure plugin Seller Verification

Plugin allows superadmin to enable/disable sellers. This can be used to verify sellers if sellers need to be verified in some capacity before being able to post items for sale.

## Testing

1. Run `yarn test` to run the e2e test.
2. Don't forget to implement your own!

## Publishing to NPM

1. Make sure you are [logged in to NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-login)
2. `yarn build`
3. `yarn publish`

That's it!
